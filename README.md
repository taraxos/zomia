Zomia is a decentralized social network connecting nomadic identities across federated communities. It is forked from Misskey and integrates the Zot/6 protocol, allowing you to communicate with friends on Mastodon, Misskey, PeerTube, PixelFed, Pleroma, Zap and any other ActivityPub-based platforms, while allowing you to back up your unique identity across the network and freely move to your own and/or other servers as desired without losing your content or connections.

You can express yourself on Zomia through short- or long-form text, images and galleries, gifs, video, audio, links, polls, and mixed media posts and choose exactly who to share those posts with, all the way from the entire public Fediverse to your local server to followers or selected friends only to direct private messages. You can also create as many separate channels as you wish for each of your interests and control them all from one interface without ever having to switch accounts. Zomia also gives you enhanced filtering and moderation tools so you and your community have as much discretion as you need for safe and free personal expression.
